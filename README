                        ******** xReg Plus v1.0 ********

DISCLAMER: This software is for the use of enabling LEGALLY obtained DLC(downloaded
	   content) if YOU HAVE CHOOSEN not to update your PS3 has the console has become
	   deactivated. It contains NO 'Offical SCE' code and was made using open source 
	   SDK psl1ght. The responsibility IS on the end-user to use this software in
	   accordance with his/her own country's/region's copyright laws.
	   
This is a simple app that will allow you to backup and restore your xRegistry.sys
file.. Good for instantly restoring your settings and getting access to your save
data again after a Service Mode install.

Also includes Activation Reviver.

You must have a backup of your act.dat file and the exdata folder must already exist 
in dev_hdd0/home/00000001/ (Currently that is the only address it copies to).

How it works.. 

1: Place act.dat onto root of USB stick and place in USB000(slot furthest right)

2: Press CIRCLE to TRANSFER act.dat to xReg Plus(XREG00001/USRDIR) from USB000

3: Press CROSS to RESTORE act.dat to PS3 exdata directory

Once this is done you only have to use step 3 each time you reboot and want to 
play DLC.

Enjoy.. Cyberskunk
